H → EMPATHY MAP:

	•	Seeing (when they check their credit score, bank account, bills): A credit score that’s “stuck” in the 600s, a bank account that’s always hovering near zero after bills are paid, a pile of credit card statements with high balances.

	•	Hearing (what others say about credit/finances): Her parents telling her to “just save more,” her friends talking about their new homes and vacations, financial gurus on social media making it look so easy.
	•	Feeling (emotional state around money): Overwhelmed, embarrassed, stressed, and a little bit angry.
