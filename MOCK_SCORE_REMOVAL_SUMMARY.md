## ‚úÖ **Verification: No More Mock Scores**

Ran these commands to verify:
```bash
grep -r "creditScore.*=.*(720|685|710|760)" src/
# Result: No matches found

grep -r "\b720\b" src/
# Result: Only 1 match in FinancialProfileSetup.tsx (placeholder text - intentional)
```

## üîç **How to Connect Real Credit Reports (Future)**

When ready to connect real credit reports, update these files to:

1. Fetch credit score from user's `financial_profile` in Firestore
2. Integrate with Experian/Equifax/TransUnion API
3. Update `creditScore` variables from `null` to actual user data
4. Show/hide "Connect Report" placeholder conditionally

Example pattern:
```typescript
const creditScore = profile?.financial_profile?.credit_score || null;

{creditScore ? (
  // Show actual score UI
) : (
  // Show "Connect Report" placeholder
)}
```
