Recommendations for LevelUp Money
1. UI/UX IMPROVEMENTS FOR LEVELUP MONEY
Dashboard Redesign Recommendations per Awareness Stage
	•	Unaware (Kevin): The current dashboard is overwhelming for Kevin. He doesn’t care about most of the metrics. A simplified dashboard that focuses on a single, engaging metric (e.g., “Your Financial Freedom Score”) would be more effective. Gamify the experience by allowing him to “level up” his score by completing simple financial tasks.
	•	Problem Aware (Jess): Jess needs to see a clear path out of her debt. The dashboard should prominently feature a personalized debt payoff plan. The “Quick Actions” are good, but they should be tailored to her specific situation (e.g., “See how you can lower your credit card interest rate”).
	•	Solution Aware (David): David wants to see the big picture. The dashboard should allow him to model different financial scenarios and see how they impact his long-term goals. He would also appreciate a more detailed breakdown of his net worth.
	•	Product Aware (Maria): Maria wants to optimize everything. The dashboard should be customizable, allowing her to choose which metrics she wants to see. She would also value a more detailed transaction analysis feature that helps her identify opportunities to save money.
	•	Most Aware (Ben): Ben wants to see all the data. The dashboard should provide a comprehensive overview of his entire financial life. He would also appreciate the ability to set and track complex financial goals (e.g., “Save for a down payment on a second home”).

Navigation Improvements to Reduce Friction
The current navigation is a bit cluttered. Consider a more streamlined approach:

	•	Group related items: “Credit Report,” “Accounts,” and “Transactions” could be grouped under a single “Financial Health” or “Accounts” section.
	•	Use progressive disclosure: Don’t show all the navigation items at once. For example, the “Debts” and “Budget” sections could be revealed after the user has connected their accounts.
	•	Personalize the navigation: The navigation should be tailored to the user’s goals. For example, if a user’s primary goal is to improve their credit score, the “Credit Report” section should be more prominent.

Visual Hierarchy Changes to Match User Mental Models
	•	Emphasize the most important information: The most important information should be the most prominent. For example, if a user is focused on paying off debt, their total debt and progress towards their goal should be the most prominent elements on the dashboard.
	•	Use color and typography to create a clear visual hierarchy: The current design is clean, but it could be more visually engaging. Use color and typography to draw attention to the most important information and create a clear visual hierarchy.
	•	Use icons to improve scannability: The current use of icons is good, but it could be more consistent. Use icons to help users quickly identify different sections of the app and understand the information presented.

Gamification Elements That Resonate with Each Avatar
	•	Unaware (Kevin): Leaderboards, badges, and points for completing simple financial tasks.
	•	Problem Aware (Jess): A visual representation of her debt payoff journey (e.g., a mountain she’s climbing), with milestones and rewards along the way.
	•	Solution Aware (David): A “financial health” score that he can track over time, with personalized recommendations for how to improve it.
	•	Product Aware (Maria): A/B testing for her own finances. For example, she could test different budgeting strategies and see which one helps her save the most money.
	•	Most Aware (Ben): The ability to set and track “stretch goals” (e.g., “Reach a $2 million net worth by 45”).

Onboarding Flow Optimizations
The current onboarding flow is a good start, but it could be more personalized and effective:

	•	Ask more qualifying questions: The onboarding flow should ask more questions to better understand the user’s financial situation, goals, and awareness level.
	•	Personalize the onboarding experience: The onboarding flow should be tailored to the user’s answers. For example, if a user says they’re struggling with debt, the onboarding flow should focus on how LevelUp Money can help them create a debt payoff plan.
	•	Show, don’t just tell: Instead of just telling users what the app can do, show them. For example, you could provide a mini-demo of the app’s key features during the onboarding flow.
