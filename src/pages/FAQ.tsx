            No! We're not anti-employment.
          </p>
          <p>
            LevelUp Money is about escaping the "Money Trap" â€” living paycheck to paycheck, constantly stressed about finances. Not about abandoning your career.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether you work a 9-to-5, run a business, or freelance, our goal is to help you:

          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 ml-4">
            <li>Spend less than you earn</li>

            <li>Achieve real financial freedom</li>

            Your job isn't the problem â€” losing control of your money is.

      question: "What is the 'Money Trap'?",
      answer: (
        <div className="space-y-3">
          <p>
            The Money Trap is the endless cycle of chasing the next paycheck or purchase, never getting ahead financially. It's characterized by:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 ml-4">
            <li>Living paycheck to paycheck</li>
            <li>Constant financial stress and anxiety</li>
            <li>Inability to save or invest for the future</li>
            <li>Feeling trapped despite earning income</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The trap isn't about how much you earn â€” it's about your relationship with money and the balance between what you consume and what you produce.
          </p>
        </div>
      )
    },
    {
      question: "What do you mean by 'Production vs. Consumption'?",
      answer: (
        <div className="space-y-3">
          <p>
            <strong>Consumption</strong> is what you spend to maintain your lifestyle â€” rent, food, entertainment, purchases, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Production</strong> is the value you create that generates income â€” your work, skills, services, or businesses.
          </p>
          <p className="bg-green-50 border-l-4 border-green-600 p-4 rounded">
            <strong>The key insight:</strong> Most people struggle not because they don't earn enough, but because their consumption overwhelms their production.
          </p>
          <p>
            LevelUp Money helps you control consumption (through budgeting and tracking) while also identifying ways to increase production (income strategies and opportunities).

      question: "Do I need to start a business or side hustle to use LevelUp Money?",
      answer: (
        <div className="space-y-3">
          <p className="font-semibold">
            Absolutely not!
          </p>
          <p>
            LevelUp Money is valuable whether you:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 ml-4">
            <li>Work a traditional 9-to-5 job</li>
            <li>Are a freelancer or contractor</li>
            <li>Run your own business</li>
            <li>Have multiple income streams</li>
            <li>Are just starting your career</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Our primary focus is helping you <strong>control your spending and track your money</strong>. Income strategies are secondary and optional â€” but available when you're ready.

      question: "How is LevelUp Money different from other finance apps?",
      answer: (
        <div className="space-y-3">
          <p>
            Most finance apps focus solely on <strong>cutting expenses</strong> (consumption control). LevelUp Money is unique because we focus on <strong>both sides of the equation</strong>:
